## Overview

For our first week, our main focus was on brainstorming and planning the foundation of our project. I initially asked each member to propose libraries and features that could be integrated into our system. Everyone actively participated and presented different, creative, and well-thought-out ideas; each one unique and useful in its own way. Because of this, we actually struggled a bit to decide which ideas to include, since all of them were worth considering.

Despite that, the process turned out really well. We collaborated smoothly, exchanged opinions respectfully, and made sure everyone’s voice was heard. I’m genuinely proud to say that I chose the best people to work with, because so far, there have been no issues when it comes to communication and teamwork. Our team’s creativity and cooperation truly made the planning phase both productive and enjoyable.
